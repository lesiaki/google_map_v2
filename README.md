#Skeleton Project

This is a Google Maps Android API v2 Skeleton Project for API Level 8 and up.

In order to run this application on your phone you'll first need to get an API key.

Instructions on how to setup your API key can be found in the [Setting up an Android Maps V2 Project][0] article.

You'll need to paste the API key into your application manifest on the following line:

```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY" android:value="INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
```
